How the Internet is Changing
=============================

Original design of internet made assumptions:
	Devices located in a fixed location (IP is almost permanent)
	The network and services are all decentralised (not fully true these days)
	Best Effort Service is enough for general use.
	Network can be trusted. (VERY NOT TRUE ANYMORE)
	Innovation can happen at fringe, network should not concern itself. (Reaching limitations, see MTU)

How has this changed?
-----------------------
Trust: Needs have changed, network is open, hence less trustworthy than past, when was closed (DARPANET)
Innovation: Cloud Compute + Giant Companies results in innovation occuring from the middle outwards.
Addressing: More devices, More machines, need more addresses. IPv4 -> v6, but slow adoption. 
	    See NAT as sticking plaster					  Global: 40-45%
									  France: 75%, UK: 45% Fuck you frenchies
Reliability: Increased use of real-time services, requires higher guarantees about speed and reliability. i.e. video conference.
Centralisation: Increased centralization, resulting in legal, moral, social consequences. Also has SECURITY costs. 
		Shift from edge based networks to HUB & Spoke topology. See EDWARD SNOWDEN (maybe mention in exams)
