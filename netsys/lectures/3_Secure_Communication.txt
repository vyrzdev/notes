Secure Communications
=======================

Data traversing network can be read/modified by all devices along the way.
Cannot be prevented (xcept in quantum lolz); Can be mitigated.
Authenticate data to verify content is genuine
Encrypt data to prevent MITM reading the data.

Many organisations monitor traffic: Govt, Business, Network Operators, Criminals
No way to stop malicious actors while allowing law enforcement.
e.g. ISP blocks illegal content via DNS; Browser uses DNS-HTTP to prevent attackers
	doing cache poisioning to maliciously redirect.
	Consider trade-off here?

Network Operators deploy MIddleboxes to monitor/modify traffic.
Some needed, some less so. Middleboxes depend on knowledge of protocol.
This is problem, PROTOCOL OSSIFICATION! Cannot change any protocols
because these middleboxes will not cope with changes. The more encrypted/
limited the protocol the better, as middleboxes will not operate on as much
of the packet/data, but limits the ability of middleboxes to be useful.

Key Escrow is where keys are stored in escrow so that govt can access it.
Creates a single attack surface for entire encrypted system, single point of failure.
Allowing govt leads to inevitable risk of malicious access via same portal.

Alternative approach; Instead of trying to monitor in transit; Monitor
at end-point. I.e. do check on/off device, from the device software;
i.e. whatsapp scan for child abuse content before sending/after receiving
Risks in accuracy of scans, etc. Dealing with this much content is hard. 

Solution of hashing content and publishing blacklist of known abuse
content by hash; Has free-speech impl. Who controls blacklist, can
it be misused to supress legal/free-speech content?

Argument to be made, that further encryption of protocols, will have both security
and anti-OSSIFICATION methods.

Designing extensible protocol makes easier to update endpoints. 
Designing encryption in transit by default makes less likely to break middleboxes;
	also limits effectiveness of middleboxes; Trade-off privacy/safety/control
