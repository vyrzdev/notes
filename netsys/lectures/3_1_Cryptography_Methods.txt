Cryptography Methods
=====================

Symmetric:
	Converts plain text into cipher;
	shared secret between sender/reciever allows for encryption/decryption.
	Very fast, good for protecting data in place (ON disk)
	Algs are public.

Asymmetric: (RSA, Diffie-Hellman)
	Public Key converts plain text into cypher text.
	Algs are public.
	Public key algs use two keys, related one-way function.
	Public key is distributed for a user;
	Private key is kept secret.
	Public key encrypts, private decrypts.
	Very slow to encrypt/decrypt; But very secure.

Hybrid:
	Uses Asymmetric to securely transmit a shared secret 
	for symettric encryption.

	Solves speed and security problems.

RSA has common mistake in impl. Must have constant runtime regardless of input
as if depends on input, can reverse to predict input/give greater clue.


How to authenticate? Prove identity/authenticity of message.
	Generate a digital signature, authenticating the message.
		do this by calculating the hash of message, and encrypting
		hash with own private key.
	
	Append this sig to the message.

	On reciever side, decrypt message with sender pub key
	Calc hash of message.
	compare hash of sender to own hash, if match, authentic.

Political issues; Must trust public key infrastructure (web certs)
