Post Quantum Computer Cryptography
====================================

Some quantum algs are capable of breaking/may break encryption
when they are able to be run. Symmetric encryption not major threat. (Factor 2 improvement, mild.)


BUT ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION relies on certain one-way ops that quantum computers can
solve with relative ease. Works on SHORS algorithm. Breaks integer factorisation, and
also Discrete Log. (RSA & ECDH respectively)

In order for this to be a risk; Quantum computers must come further.
As of now, does not exist yet in public eye. May exist; likely will sooner
than expected

Currently exist bounty/prize for secure quantum algorithm.
IETF has a working group.

See Kyber, lattice crypto???
