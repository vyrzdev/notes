A1: Relational Model, Company
================================

A company is organized into departments. Each department has a unique
        number, and a particular employee who manages the department.

	We keep track of the start date that employee began managing the
        department.

A department may have several locations.

A department controls a number of projects, each of which has a unique name,
	number and a single location.

The company stores the information about the employee (e.g., name, salary,
	birth date, â€¦), and the unique social security number. An employee is assigned
	only to one department, but may work on several projects, which are not
	necessarily controlled by the same department.

We keep track of the current number of hours per week that an employee
	works on each project and their direct supervisor, who is another employee.

The company keeps track of the dependent (e.g., child) of each employee for
	insurance purposes and the corresponding relationship with the employee (e.g.,
	son, daughter).

Immediately can start building entities, but this is not a science. 
Important to formalise in order to find the provably best form for the DB.

Entities: Departments, Employees, Projects, Dependent
Relationships:
	Employee manages dept.
	Dept may have 1+ locations
	Dept controls N projects
	Employee assigned to 1 dept.
	Employee MAY work on N Projects, controlled by various depts
	Employee supervised by Supervisor (who is employee)
	Employee has N dependents, each with a specific relationship to employee.
