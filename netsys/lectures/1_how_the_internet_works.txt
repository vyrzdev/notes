How the Internet Works
========================

Protocols & Layers :: Good way to think, not super applicable.
-------------------
Physical: Cable/Modulation Scheme/Radio Freq - The physical transport upon which data is transmitted.
Data-Link: Eth/Wifi/ADSL - Connection Negotiation, Identity, Message format etc. e.g. 802.1.1.x
	   Handles communication between device and the next closest on the network. I.e. base stn.
           Hop-By-Hop, only 2 devices.
Network: Handles communication between many devices, crossing many data-links. Makes these seperate
	 links appear as if they are a single network. Handles tracking identity of devices, BUT NOT ROUTING/TRANSMISSION

Transport: Handles transport of data across a network between disparate entities. Handles routing.

Session Layer: Part of transport (sort of, see QUIC) - Handles app level communication, i.e. HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.

Who develops this?
--------------------
IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force - IP/TCP/etc
W3C: Web Consortium - HTML/HTTP (superceded by IETF)
3GPP: 3rd Gen Partnership Program - Mobile data protocols etc.
ITU: Int Telecoms Union - Radio Stds

Layers of Governance? :: See IGF/ICANN/Internet Society
--------------------
Social Layer: Rights, Norms, Laws (Govt)
Content Layer: Intellectual Property, Spam (...?)
Logical Layer: Naming, Numbering, Standards/Protocols, etc. (IETF/W3C)
Infrastructure Layer: Access to the internet, Availability of Services. (ISPs)

Physical Layer
--------------------
Baseband: Used for direct connection, i.e. eth. See Manchester/NRZ Encoding
Modulated: Used for radio communication, i.e. wlan.
	Shannon's Theorem :: C = B * log2(1+ S/N)
	---------------------------------------------
	Shannon's Theorem gives an upper bound to the capacity of a link, in bits per second (bps),
	as a function of the available bandwidth and the signal-to-noise ratio of the link.
	where C is the achievable channel capacity, B is the bandwidth of the line, 
	S is the average signal power and N is the average noise power.	

Data-Link Layer
---------------------

Eth:    8 byte    6 byte 6 byte 2b  ? bytes      4+ byte
	preamble  source dest   len data         ECC
	<--------><-----><-----><--><-----------><----->
	(known)   <----------------> 
          	  14 byte header
Preamble enables syncronization of clock signals. Alternates 1/0
Made up of 7 bytes and 1 SFD (ending in 1 to break preamble pattern)
			 (start frame delimeter)

CSMACD :: Helps prevent collision, etc.
	Carrier Sense - Listen before sending, if sum1 else sending, wait. (randomized but increases with collisions)
	Multiple Access - Many clients on network at once.
	Collision Detection - If sum1 sends while sending, stop and wait (randomized ditto.)

Network Layer
--------------------
IP
	TTL: # hops OR some time heuristic
	Best effort delivery, failure is thrown out, data lost.
	No guarantees, as a feature, works over variable quality links, TCP handles delivery.
	No Quality of Service (DSCP can do QOS in theory, specifying needs, but often ignored or EVEN SET TO 0)
IPV6
	More addresses (128 bits not 32)
	Hop Limit not TTL (nobody used time heuristic)
	No Fragmentation, in IPv4 was present to allow packets to be fragmented mid-journey
			  by routers, depending on MTU of next hop. In IPv6 is done end-to-end.
	DSCP still present?

Packets, not Packages (Messages are sent in pieces not all at once.)
Entrappening networking??
InterDomain Networking??

Transport Layer
---------------------

UDP: ____ Datagram Protocol
	   
	Consists of: Port #, and Length field (redundant)
				 as already included in IP
				 but pointless as UDP
				 packets are insular.

	Is not reliable, no delivery guarantee, no ordering guarantee, no uniqueness guarantee.
	Left to protocol above in stack.

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

	Consists of:  ...

	Is reliable, provides delivery, ordering, uniqueness guarantees.
	If packets are lost, will be retransmitted. If packets are duplicated, will be detected. If out of order, will reorder.
	Downside is, slower sometimes, higher latency. Not ideal for gaming/video/realtime communications.
	Reciever sends back ACK packets.

	TCP Handshake:
		SYN ->
		    <- SYN + ACK
		ACK ->
		ESTABLISHED
		
		----- SECURITY ----- TLS (Transport Layer Security)
		Keys/Auth handshake.

		----- DATA -----
		FIN ->
		    <- FIN + ACK
		ACK -> 

	QUIC bypasses two seperate handshakes, established security as guarantee during initial handshake.
	When TCP recieves 3 duplicate ACKS, sender will resend? TODO

Session Layer
-------------------------
Handles structure of comms, i.e. P2P/Client Server/Federated System (Torrent with peers and trackers)

Missing Layers (Political/Financial)
--------------------------------------
Important to think about COST and POLITICS of designed protocols.
In order to design a protocol and have it adopted, must agree on format.
This effort is extremely political. See QUIC, IPv6. See older formats that have died 
	i.e. IPX/SPX, IP alternatives that failed to achieve market share.
