Secure Coding
===============

Protocol Design:
	Be liberal in what you accept;
	CONSERVATIVE in what you send!

	Postels law; he lived with pals; today we live with sharks.
	Postel is WRONG!

	Common attacks send malformed input.
	By restricting valid input domain/language you make
	it simpler to ensure data conforms safely.
	Lower attack surface

Can make no assumptions about input form. Must guarantee all.
